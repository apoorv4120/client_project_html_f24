        <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>
        <p>Uwill is an addition to CAPS services that provides students with video, phone, chat, and message sessions with licensed mental health professionals at no cost. This additional counseling option offers students greater flexibility and allows CAPS to expand its service capacity.</p>
